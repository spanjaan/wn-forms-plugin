## Why Use Magic Forms?

We often create forms for work or personal projects.

Sometimes, we need to change fields, update rules, or save data. Doing this all the time can get boring.

Magic Forms makes it simple. Just add the HTML, and it will save the data or send it by email without extra effort!
